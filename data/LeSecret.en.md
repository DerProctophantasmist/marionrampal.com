*When Alice went through the looking glass, at first, everything seemed strange to her. Then she got used to it.  
Le Secret is a nostalgic, fanciful and sometimes funny invitation to consider differently what seems well known, immutable, untouchable. It is an impertinent and elegant walk between Baudelaire’s melancholia and the blues, with two respectful rebels whom no music genre can imprison as guides . To make a jazz standard out of a Fauré melody or a Schubert Song is a bridge to cross oceans and musical territories; to add one beat to bring Verlaine closer to New Orleans, it is all possible when you master the codes of each different universe to perfection. Marion Rampal and Pierre-François Blanchard are daring and unapologetic, taking all the risks like a couple of tightrope walkers, confident in every step.  
Their secret is special, bizarre, offbeat, a strange cocktail of poetry, classical music, humour, improvisation, with dizzy precipitations in refreshing colours, with rivers and seas to roll and swing. Two legendary musicians join them on this journey : Archie Shepp and Raúl Barboza.  
Welcome to Wonderland!*

#### MARION RAMPAL & PIERRE-FRANÇOIS BLANCHARD
Jazz singer-songwriter Marion Rampal and pianist Pierre-François Blanchard are developing a common language of interpretation that challenges established codes.  
Lovers of classical melody, Great Black Music, French popular songs, collaborators of jazz master Archie Shepp and seminal french songwriter Pierre Barouh, they are constantly looking for a poetic and sonic link that transcends styles, and reveal the expressive heart of songs in delicious drifts.  
With Le Secret they invent new standards by exploring melodies of yesteryears, musical poems that are "deep mirrors" where the movements of the soul are reflected in liquid materialsg Melancholia, Blues or spicy fantasy.  
Mirroring the composition of French Art Songs from Belle Époque to Nouvelle Vague, playing like them with metamorphosis, this duo demonstrates an art of suspending time, following in the footsteps of the great jazz improvisers.
