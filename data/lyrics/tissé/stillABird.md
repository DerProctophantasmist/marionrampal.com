I’ll work hard  
I know how  
I’ll work it out  
I’ll make it plain  
But I’m a bird  
And you know birds  
The way they mock  
And y away  
I’m trying hard to nd the measure  
One hand is free  
One’s in the back  
I wanna make you the proper treasure  
Out of the stones  
I rolled around  
And the Moon is sad and changes  
And we cannot see her faces  
She looks the other way around  
And turns a thousand times  
And you’re like a planet in motion  
And your love demands a revolution  
There’s a hidden line ‘round the globe  
For birds to follow your track  
If I play cool  
I’m no fool  
I made it here the way I could  
I’m still a bird by every measure  
I sing at night when there’s a light  
A little pain  
A little pleasure  
Is all it takes to work it out  
I might ask you where you’ve been  
But you won’t say why you had gone  
And if there’s something left for us to sing  
Well you know  
I’ll be glad to sing along  
I’m still a bird  
I’m still a bird
