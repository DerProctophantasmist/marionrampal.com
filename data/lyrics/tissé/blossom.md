Go away, shadowsGo away  
The morning comes at last  
It’s time my dreams scattered away  
All among the clouds  
Don’t go away, thoughts  
Don’t go away  
If I ever dare to fall again  
I would bleed, dear  
I would bleed  
Though you know I’d never lie to you  
I’d just say half  
I’d just sing  
Strong winds are pushing us  
Ahead towards our end  
And the light draws another angle  
It’s time just to say:  
« We lived as though, Love,  
We lived as though … »  
If I ever dare to love again  
I would bleed, dear  
I would bleed  
Though you know I’ll never lie to you  
I’ll just say half  
I’ll just sing  
I’ll just sing
