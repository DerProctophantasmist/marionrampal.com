I stand along  
I stand a while  
The wheel goes up  
The wheel goes down  
If I could hold still until tomorrow  
I’d see my thoughts flee in a row  
An angel came  
An angel went  
Was it a real one  
Or a fake?  
We’ll never know until tomorrow  
When shadows land, if they might grow  
Away away away away I’ll follow  
The small cracks on your wall  
Don’t let it go  
If you believe  
There’s still a song  
That we can bring  
When we’re like grass along the railroad  
Or simple shadows on the floor  
Away away away away I’ll follow  
The small lines on your wall  
Away away away away I’ll stumble  
Be like the rain and leave no ghost
